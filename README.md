# Analyze A/B Test Results

### Introduction

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.  It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these 

For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.


#### Conclusion
> The p-value here suggests that that new page is not statistically significant as 0.19 > 0.05.
>z_score is less than 1.6448, therefore, we would fail to reject the Null.
>In this study, We conclude that, as there is no significant evidence to choose the $H_1$ alternative hypothesis it's better to stay with the old page rather than choosing the new page.
